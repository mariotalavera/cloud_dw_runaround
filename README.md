## About



## Questions For phData

1. What position am I applying for? Data Engineer or Soln Architect? Why not the other? Could you please clarify as this applies to me.

2. Is the project challenge a general competitive analysis between cloud providers or am I supposed to leverage both providers and deliver a singular solution? I could interpret both by reading the doc provided. Should I?
- Do the same analysis on both clouds? 
- Do one analysis combining both cloud providers?
- For example, the Databricks Section states to persist data in Snowflake instead.
